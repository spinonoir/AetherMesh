# **Project AetherMesh: Autonomous Drone Swarm Coordination**

## **1\. Project Summary**

**AetherMesh** is an advanced robotics project focused on developing a decentralized coordination system for a swarm of autonomous drones. The core of the project is to use **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** to train drones to perform complex, collaborative tasks like formation flying, obstacle avoidance, and simulated search-and-rescue missions.

A key technical innovation is the use of a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** to process the swarm's communication, allowing for intelligent, emergent behavior even with realistic network limitations. The project will be developed in a professional, **MLOps-focused environment**, using Docker for reproducibility, PX4-Gazebo for high-fidelity simulation, and ROS2 for robotic communication. The initial target hardware platform for physical deployment will be based on **CUAV** components, which are fully compatible with the chosen PX4 flight stack.

## **2\. Simulation Environment**

The project has officially selected **PX4-Gazebo** as its primary simulation environment.

#### **Simulators Considered**

* **Microsoft AirSim**: Known for its photorealistic graphics, making it ideal for training computer vision models. However, its heavy computational demand makes simulating multiple agents slow, which is a major drawback for a swarm project.  
* **PX4-Gazebo**: The standard simulator for the PX4 flight stack. It is recognized for its high-fidelity *physics* and *flight dynamics*, as it runs the exact same firmware as the physical drone.

#### **Reasoning for Choice**

**PX4-Gazebo** was chosen for three key reasons that directly align with the goals of AetherMesh:

1. **Performance for MARL**: The ability to run simulations faster than real-time is crucial for efficiently training complex multi-agent reinforcement learning models.  
2. **Superior Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Because the simulation runs the actual PX4 flight code, control strategies developed in the simulator have a much higher chance of working on real hardware with minimal changes.  
3. **Community and Standards**: It integrates natively with ROS2 and is the standard for the open-source drone development community, making it a robust and well-supported choice.
